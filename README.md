# Randomness 1
An experiment in random music.

Inspired by Arvo Pärt, a random melody in D major, accompanied by a tintinnabuli D Major triad.  The phrasing comes from Für Alina.

```node randomness1.js > randomness1.mid```

Then import the midi file into your DAW etc.

I used Ableton with the Native Instruments Grandeur piano:-
